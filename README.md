# MPU9150_SensorFusionDisplay
Contains code for streaming MPU6050 accelerometer/gyro data over Wifi UDP packets with a NodeMCU to a Python PyQTGraph GUI for displaying the streaming data.

You will need a NodeMCU, MPU6050 (or compatible accelerometer such as the MPU9050, the code works for both) and install PyQTGraph to display the received packets on your computer.
